    Should I also list human tasks in my Nextflow-managed workflow tasks?

=> ChatGPT:
    In the context of a Nextflow-managed workflow, it is generally not necessary to include human tasks as part of the workflow definition. Nextflow workflows are designed to automate and manage computational tasks rather than human-driven activities. The purpose of a workflow in this context is to orchestrate the execution of various computational processes, handle data dependencies, and ensure reproducibility.

    However, it is worth noting that Nextflow workflows can interface with external processes or tools that involve human interaction. For example, you may have steps in your workflow that require manual data curation, annotation, or expert review. In such cases, you can include placeholders or manual instructions within the workflow to guide the human tasks, but the execution of these tasks would occur outside the workflow itself.

    For instance, you could include comments or instructions in the workflow's documentation or code annotations to indicate when and how manual tasks should be performed. These instructions can provide details on the expected input or output formats, guidelines for data curation, or steps for expert review. The workflow can then resume once the manual tasks are completed and the required data is available for further automated processing.

    Remember that Nextflow is primarily designed to manage and automate computational tasks, but it can be flexible enough to incorporate interactions or collaborations with human tasks when necessary.
